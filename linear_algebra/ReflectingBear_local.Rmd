# Reflecting Bear

## Background

Panda Bear is confused. He is trying to work out how things should look when
reflected in a mirror, but is getting the wrong results. In Bear's coordinates,
the mirror lies along the first axis. But, as is the way with bears, his
coordinate system is not orthonormal: so what he thinks is the direction
perpendicular to the mirror isn't actually the direction the mirror reflects
in. Help Bear write a code that will do his matrix calculations properly!

## Instructions

In this assignment you will write a Python function that will produce
a transformation matrix for reflecting vectors in an arbitrarily angled mirror.

Building on the last assignment, where you wrote a code to construct an
orthonormal basis that spans a set of input vectors, here you will take
a matrix which takes simple form in that basis, and transform it into our
starting basis. Recall the from the last video,

\\( T = E T_E E^{-1} \\)

You will write a function that will construct this matrix. This assessment is
not conceptually complicated, but will build and test your ability to express
mathematical ideas in code. As such, your final code submission will be
relatively short, but you will receive less structure on how to write it.

### Matrices in Python

For this exercise, we shall make use of the @ operator again. Recall from the
last exercise, we used this operator to take the dot product of vectors. In
general the operator will combine vectors and/or matrices in the expected
linear algebra way, i.e. it will be either the vector dot product, matrix
multiplication, or matrix operation on a vector, depending on it's input. For
example to calculate the following expressions,

\\( a = \mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{t} \\)

\\( \mathbf{s} = A\mathbf{t} \\)

\\( M = A B \\),

One would use the code,

```python
a = s @ t
s = A @ t
M = A @ B
```

(This is in contrast to the \\( * \\) operator, which performs element-wise
multiplication, or multiplication by a scalar.)

You may need to use some of the following functions:

```python
inv(A)
transpose(A)
gsBasis(A)
```

These, respectively, take the inverse of a matrix, give the transpose of
a matrix, and produce a matrix of orthonormal column vectors given a general
matrix of column vectors - i.e. perform the Gram-Schmidt process. This exercise
will require you to combine some of these functions.

### How to submit

Edit the code in the cells below to complete the assignment. Once you are
finished and happy with it, press the *Submit Assignment* button at the top of
this notebook.

Please don't change any of the function names, as these will be checked by the
grading script.

If you have further questions about submissions or programming assignments, here
is a

of Q&A. You can also raise an issue on the discussion forum. Good luck!

```{python}
# PACKAGE
import numpy as np
import numpy.linalg as la
from readonly.bearNecessities import *
```

```{python}
# GRADED FUNCTION
def build_reflection_matrix(bearBasis):
    """Compute the reflection matrix in the Bear's basis.

    Arguments:
        bearBasis: Array of shape (2, 2). Bear's basis.

    Returns:
        T: Array of shape (2, 2). Reflection matrix.
    """

    # Compute the mirror's orthonormal basis:
    E = gsBasis(bearBasis)

    # Matrix that performs the reflection in the mirror's basis:
    TE = np.array([[1,  0],
                   [0, -1]])

    # Use E and TE to compute the reflection matrix T:
    T = TE @ la.inv(E)
    T = E @ T

    return T
```

## Test your code before submission

To test the code you've written above, run the cell (select the cell above,
then press the play button [ â–¶| ] or press shift-enter). You can then use the
code below to test out your function. You don't need to submit this cell; you
can edit and run it as much as you like.

The code below will show a picture of Panda Bear. If you have correctly
implemented the function above, you will also see Bear's reflection in his
mirror. The orange axes are Bear's basis, and the pink axes are the mirror's
orthonormal basis.

```{python}
# Load pyplot:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# %matplotlib inline


# Matrix of Bear's basis vectors:
bearBasis = np.array([[  1, -1],
                      [1.5,  2]])

# Compute the reflection matrix:
T = build_reflection_matrix(bearBasis)

# Compute Bear's reflection by applying the T matrix:
reflected_bear_black_fur = T @ bear_black_fur
reflected_bear_face      = T @ bear_face
reflected_bear_white_fur = T @ bear_white_fur

# Set up the graphics environment:
ax = draw_mirror(bearBasis)

# Plot Bear:
ax.fill(bear_white_fur[0], bear_white_fur[1], color=bear_white, zorder=1)
ax.fill(bear_black_fur[0], bear_black_fur[1], color=bear_black, zorder=2)
ax.plot(     bear_face[0],      bear_face[1], color=bear_white, zorder=3)

# Plot Bear's reflection:
ax.fill(reflected_bear_white_fur[0], reflected_bear_white_fur[1], color=bear_white, zorder=1)
ax.fill(reflected_bear_black_fur[0], reflected_bear_black_fur[1], color=bear_black, zorder=2)
ax.plot(     reflected_bear_face[0],      reflected_bear_face[1], color=bear_white, zorder=3);
```
