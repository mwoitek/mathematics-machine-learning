============================

I completed a 3-part on-line course on the Mathematics for Machine Learning. To
do so, I had to submit a few programming assignments. This repo contains the
corresponding Jupyter notebooks. Specifically, in this repository you'll find
the solutions to the following assignments:

* Part 1: Linear Algebra
    1. Identifying Special Matrices
    1. Gram-Schmidt Process
    1. Reflecting Bear
    1. Page Rank
* Part 2: Multivariate Calculus
    1. Backpropagation
    1. Fitting the Distribution of Height Data
* Part 3: PCA
    1. Mean/Covariance of a Dataset + Effect of a Linear Transformation
    1. Inner Products and Angles
    1. Orthogonal Projections
    1. PCA
